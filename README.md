- 👋 Hi, I’m @teachtech1088
- 👀 I’m interested in any and everything involving technology. In my spare time I love to program Rasbperry Pi devices to operate RetroPie in order to play old school games on older systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python to become even better at programming the Raspberry Pi systems and Networking and Security.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on programming/coding and software/game testing.
- 📫 I can be reached via email at twint1088@gmail.com
